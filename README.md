# Deprecating `document.domain`

## A Problem

Given that computers are broken, it's reasonable to assume a threat model which posits that it is [impossible to create a security boundary inside a single address space](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/security/side-channel-threat-model.md). It's incumbent upon us, then, to align browsers' process model to the web's security boundaries. [Site Isolation](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/site-isolation) is a big step in that direction, allowing origins to be partitioned by eTLD+1, cleanly separating `attacker.example` from `secrets.example`. Site-level isolation is, however, insufficient as [same-site-but-cross-origin attacks](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/security/side-channel-threat-model.md#multiple-origins-within-a-siteinstance) remain a real threat. Ideally, we'd map the process boundary to an origin, not a site.

There are several challenges to shipping origin-level isolation, but the clearest blocker is the impact that such isolation would have on the ability to relax the same-origin policy through `document.domain`. Using this mechanism, same-site-but-cross-origin documents can decide they should be able to synchronously script each other at runtime, which makes it impossible to commit them into distinct processes _a priori_. In addition to preventing broad adoption of origin-level process isolation, this feature is bad in itself, as it significantly complicates both the implementation of the web's security boundary, and the expectations we can reasonably set for web developers.

Despite [admonitions against its usage in the HTML spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/origin.html#relaxing-the-same-origin-restriction), the setter is unfortunately quite pervasive, affecting at least [~0.4% of page views in Chrome](https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/2544) (down from ~6% thanks to [Facebook's heroic efforts](https://twitter.com/mikewest/status/1136861248186998784)).

## A Proposal

Accepting the post-Spectre threat model means that we must begin work in earnest to unblock origin-level process isolation by removing the `document.domain` setter from the platform, sooner rather than later. Given its broad usage, an iterative approach to removal seems reasonable.

We can begin with simple subsetting: the setter should be disabled in the presence of `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` headers, as it already is for `Origin-Isolation` and `crossOriginIsolated` documents.

Beyond that, note that web developers are able to opt-out of `document.domain` usage via the [`document-domain` Feature Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Feature-Policy/document-domain). This provides a clean ratcheting mechanism we could use to reduce usage over time, by changing the policy's default allowlist from `*` to `'none'` (after some period of appropriate developer-facing messaging in places like browsers' developer console and Lighthouse). This allowlist change would disable `document.domain` by default, but allow developers to opt back into it by setting an explicit `Feature-Policy: document-domain 'src'` header, which allows us to track usage via HTTP Archive and browser telemetry, and to make appropriate decisions about a document's process when committing it.

As we reduce usage over time, we can strengthen this initial shift by requiring additional opt-in. Enterprise policies and reverse origin trials come to mind as subsequent milestones.

_Note that the Feature Policy opt-out currently causes the setter to throw; a no-op might be more compatible._

## FAQ

### What should developers use instead?

`window.postMessage()` provides an explicit communication channel for cross-origin collaboration.

### Do we know anything useful about the ~0.4% usage noted above?

Trawling through HTTP Archive, we see 3,986 (of 5,438,156: 0.07%) pages in the 2020-09-01 desktop corpus, and 2,650 (of 6,845,384: 0.04%) in the mobile corpus. I've compiled these [into a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jERqy1Up1bdHH5SZhy7e0qxaZY7IFBkEpgvqYyGtiMw/edit?usp=sharing) for easier parsing.

Skimming through the data, a few examples seem worth poking at:

* Alibaba runs storefronts at ~950 `*.alibaba.com` domains (i.e. `https://baominhjsc.trustpass.alibaba.com/`) that rely on `document.domain` to communicate with a messenger widget from `onetalk.alibaba.com`. `58.com` and `fang.com` seem to have similar arrangements.

* `qq.com` has ~120 subdomains that rely on `document.domain` to communicate login status with frames like `apps.game.qq.com`.

* `bbc.com` loads a media player from `emp.bbc.com`. It doesn't look essential; the page continues to work after setting `document.domain` to something else in the console.

* `www.naver.com` depends on it more directly, from a `siape.veta.naver.com` frame. It appears that it's doing viewport checks which `IntersectionOberver` might better address?

* `www.sina.com.cn` has a lazy-load script that seems to do viewport checks; `IntersectionObserver` or `loading=lazy` might be better fits.


### Won't relying on Feature Policy make it difficult for frames to opt-in?

Yes. The top-level document will need to opt-in, and do so in a way that enables the feature for same-site nested documents. Something like `Feature-Policy: document-domain 'src'` would likely be effective.
